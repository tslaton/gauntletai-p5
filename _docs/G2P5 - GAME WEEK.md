# **Game Week Project Guide**

## **Background**

Most of you have never built a game before. That's exactly the point.

This week isn't about becoming game developers. It's about proving you can enter completely unfamiliar territory and ship polished, production-quality software using AI as your learning engine.

In the real world, you'll face situations where your boss assigns you to a project using technologies you've never touched. Maybe it's a legacy system in COBOL. Maybe it's a cutting-edge framework that launched last month. Maybe it's an industry-specific tool that nobody on your team has experience with. The question becomes: Can you get up to speed fast enough to contribute meaningfully?

This project tests your ability to:

* Rapidly acquire expertise in unfamiliar domains using AI  
* Make informed technical decisions without prior experience  
* Build a methodology for AI-accelerated learning that you can apply anywhere  
* Deliver polished results despite starting from zero

We're using game development as the vehicle because:

1. It's likely unfamiliar territory for most of you  
2. Games demand technical excellence \- performance issues are immediately visible  
3. The quality bar is clear \- it either feels good to play or it doesn't  
4. Multiplayer requirements add genuine technical complexity

By the end of this week, you'll have developed a repeatable process for using AI to master new technologies and deliver professional results in record time.

## **Core Challenge**

You will develop a multiplayer game using technologies you have never worked with before. This project tests your ability to:

* Research and learn new technologies rapidly using AI  
* Make informed technical decisions under time constraints  
* Build production-quality software in unfamiliar territory  
* Demonstrate that AI-augmented developers can match or exceed traditional development timelines

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Game Specifications**

* **Multiplayer Support:** Real-time interaction between multiple players  
* **Performance:** Low latency, high performance gameplay with no lag  
* **Platform:** Your choice \- mobile, web, or desktop application  
* **Complexity:** Must include levels or character progression \- players need a sense of advancement  
* **Engagement:** Fun, interesting gameplay with clear objectives or storyline

### **Development Pathways**

Choose one of these pathways based on your target platform. Each pathway has been selected for having excellent documentation, active communities, and AI-friendly learning resources:

#### **Path 1: Desktop Game Development with Godot**

* **Engine:** Godot  
* **Language:** GDScript (Python-like syntax)  
* **Networking:** Godot's built-in multiplayer API  
* **Why this path:** Godot has exceptional documentation, thousands of tutorials, and GDScript is designed to be beginner-friendly. The engine handles many complex tasks for you while still teaching core game development concepts.

#### **Path 2: Browser-Based Game**

* **Framework:** Phaser 3 (2D) or Three.js (3D)  
* **Language:** JavaScript  
* **Networking:** Socket.io for real-time multiplayer  
* **Why this path:** Both frameworks have extensive documentation. Phaser 3 is perfect for 2D games with built-in physics and animations. Three.js opens up 3D possibilities if you want an extra challenge. Socket.io simplifies multiplayer implementation.

#### **Path 3: Unity for Cross-Platform**

* **Engine:** Unity  
* **Language:** C\#  
* **Networking:** Unity Netcode for GameObjects or Mirror Networking  
* **Platform:** Desktop or WebGL build  
* **Why this path:** Unity has the largest game development community, countless tutorials, and comprehensive documentation. C\# is well-structured and extensively covered by AI training data.

## **Final Notes**

This project simulates real-world scenarios where developers must quickly adapt to new technologies. Your ability to leverage AI for rapid learning and development is the key differentiator. Focus on smart decision-making, efficient learning paths, and pragmatic implementation choices.

Remember: The goal isn't perfection in 7 daysâ€”it's demonstrating that AI-augmented developers can achieve in one week what might traditionally take much longer when facing unfamiliar technology stacks.
