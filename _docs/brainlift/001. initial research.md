I have this project requirements document. You should follow the guidelines somewhat loosely, because the program is mostly grading our learning and delivery of _something_ impressive. But it will need to have multiplayer and not be a buggy mess.

My own leanings are to do either a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania like Hollow Knight or Metroid: Dread or an FPS adventure like Halo, Half-Life 2, or Metroid: Prime. With any of them, I don't expect to produce multiple levels or many enemies on the timeline we have (one week). So we should focus on an MVP and producing one good level. The game could be expanded later.

I am open to other ideas as well, because my game ideas above are biased toward a single-player (potentially cooperative) experience. Help me come up with something original I am excited and confident I can build.

We are on Day 1, and just started so primarily you are helping plan the game itself (characters, world, premise, gameplay) and the platform, tools, and architecture that will help me ship it.

If I were to go for a competitive multiplayer networked game, I have enjoyed animated card games like HearthStone, Gwent, or Legends of Runeterra (especially this one). So that is also a possibility. Players would progress by ranking up in matchmaking and acquiring more cards.
