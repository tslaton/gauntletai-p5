# Game concepts and risk assessments 
[link](https://claude.ai/chat/deb91e57-847b-4619-ab1e-ad3747edc3ba)

## 1. **Ghost Protocol: Asymmetric Stealth Metroidvania**

_A 2D side-scrolling game where one player is a corporate android infiltrator and the other is a rogue AI ghost haunting the facility_

**Premise**: In a cyberpunk research facility, players work together (or against each other) - one as a physical android breaking in, the other as a digital consciousness possessing systems and objects.

## 2. **Escape Velocity: Co-op Space Horror FPS**

_A first-person survival game where 2-4 players wake from cryosleep on a derelict ship with something hunting them_

**Premise**: Players must work together to restore ship systems while one player is secretly infected and occasionally transforms into the hunter (rotating role).

## 3. **Circuit Breakers: Competitive Mech Arena**

_A 2.5D platform fighter where players customize lightweight mechs for fast-paced battles_

**Premise**: In illegal underground mech fights, pilots compete using modular mechs with swappable parts that drastically change playstyle mid-match.

## 4. **Dimensional Rift: Puzzle-Platform Co-op**

_A 2D puzzle-platformer where players exist in parallel dimensions and must manipulate reality to help each other progress_

**Premise**: Two explorers are split across dimensions after an experiment goes wrong. What's solid in one dimension might be ethereal in another.

## 5. **The Last Frequency: Souls-like Boss Rush**

_A minimalist 3D action game where players team up to defeat massive corrupted AIs_

**Premise**: As the last free androids, players must infiltrate and destroy towering AI cores that have consumed the world, Shadow of the Colossus style.
