- **assets, especially animations are my major concern/bottleneck**
	- even if I did make my own, I don't have time to make many and ship an actual game
	- it seems like **prefab fantasy assets are easier to find than sci-fi assets**
	- Spine2D would definitely be a top contender for a longer project...
		- more fluid skinning/edits...

In order of perceived difficulty (low to high) given what I see in assets...

- 2D scrolling spaceship shooter
- **card game**
	- fun mechanics are a slight risk
	- vfx slight risk
- terraforming mars (or some other board game)
- futuristic racing game
	- don't know much but seems doable
	- what's the progression?
- **Star Fox** (on rails racer/shooter)
	- [tutorial](https://youtu.be/JVbr7osMYTo?feature=shared)
- 2D top down fantasy combat
	- environment matching and enemies are risks
- 3D sword combat game
	- flashy due to assets
	- progression?
- 2D sidescroller
	- fantasy combat... not super interesting, levels and enemies are risks
	- metroidvania + asymmetry... not much sci fi art... enemies are risks
- puzzle-platformer
	- ideally 3D like portal... 3D is a risk, as are puzzles

The rails racer/shooter avoids advanced enemy ai, most physics, and _animations_ while still providing lots challenges of its own. It could be polished and fun. Every other idea except the card game feels more dependent on and _at the mercy of_ asset packs to get of the ground in a coherent way. For the rails shooter and the card game, I feel more confident AI is at the level I can generate my own assets.
