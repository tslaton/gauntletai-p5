# Why

- feels dynamic without too many animations
- think Midjourney => Meshy pipeline can create assets adequately
- multiple options for two player mode

# Concept

3D Rail shooter like Star Fox 64 where the player is flying in space or on the surface of a planet, dodging obstacles and enemy projectiles, picking up power-ups, and shooting down enemies.

# Inspirations

- Star Fox 64
- rails chase/shooter scenes in Split Fiction

# Examples of two-player mechanics

		- players can get arbitrarily ahead of each other
		- has a grapple + jet ski section in addition to flying...
		- has a grapple + running section (on rotating train)
		- has side-scrolling rail shooter for boss battle
- one player is behind, shooting at the other(s)

# Game engine

[Claude's opinion](https://claude.ai/chat/02d0d0ac-12bb-4593-99e0-c052598eb5e1): Unity
- performance and asset loading
- proven track record of making rail shooters, so there are  tutorials
- claim: Godot is weaker for 3D, Three.js is weaker in asset loading and performance
- personal: I would like to master Unity, though it's daunting

Later, Claude suggested Godot for development speed. The project is currently using Godot.

# Questions

Q: What are some 3D asset libraries for spaceships, asteroids, and other objects that would work well for a rails shooter like Star Fox 64 where the player is flying in space or on the surface of a planet, dodging obstacles and enemy projectiles, picking up power-ups, and shooting down enemies?

A: [Perplexity answer](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-some-3d-asset-librari-Gjrx2k8uSpClMeh9OP8fJQ)

Q: `.fbx` vs .`obj`

A: [Perplexity answer](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/fbx-obj-what-is-best-for-three-ckFE5x9fR0e8YC4.ihAGiQ)
- `.fbx` includes animations, textures, rigging, bones, scenes, all-in-one
- `.obj` is just vertices, normals, uv coordinates, and faces (geometry)

Q: Is it fairly trivial to develop in split screen (for testing two players) but later give each player their own screen over the network?

A: [Claude answer](https://claude.ai/chat/02d0d0ac-12bb-4593-99e0-c052598eb5e1): yes
