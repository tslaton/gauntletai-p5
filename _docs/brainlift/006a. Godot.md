# Overview: key concepts

## Scenes

- scene = character, weapon, menu, house, level... many things
- scenes can be nested
- game is held together as a scene tree

## Nodes

- scenes are composed of >= 1 nodes
- nodes are the smallest building block and are arranged into trees
- library of many node types

## Signals

- nodes emit signals as event occurs
- these allow nodes to communicate
- follow the [observer pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html)

I completed the tutorial up through 3D, but skipping 2D. In general it is fairly intuitive, aside from all of the nesting in the Inspector pane and many hidden properties that follow the pattern "I don't know what I don't know."

Interesting that many things _can_ be done in code, but the intended flow appears to be through the Godot UI. Most of the files appear to be git-compatible plaintext, although syntax highlighting is only okay (eg., Git Tower doesn't support Godot)
