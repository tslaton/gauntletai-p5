- [ ] improve look and feel following [Recreating Star Fox's Rail Movement | Mix and Jam](https://youtu.be/JVbr7osMYTo?feature=shared)
- tried Midjourney -> Meshy pipeline
	- I got pretty good results but the Meshy model needs edits... time to learn Blender?
- should I used Blender or Godot to create the planet and the track?
	- [Claude initially suggested Blender](https://claude.ai/chat/60b25ef3-e504-4ff2-94f6-d1ba8aac8edd), but it sounds like Godot is capable and easier for me
- aiming...
	- at first I had the crosshairs fixed to the center of the ship and the bullets fired forward
	- this felt off... so I had the bullets target the center of the far crosshair... but it wasn't far enough, and bullets criss-crossed beyond it
	- setting the target distance farther... didn't align with the crosshairs
	- my current solution, which finally _feels correct_ is to take the vector from crosshair1 to crosshair2, imagine a crosshair3 along the same vector but at BULLET_RECYCLE_DISTANCE, and aim at crosshair3

Creating a planetary surface... (see [[003. Creating the planetary surface]])
- Grok 4 and Claude did not one-shot it, not exactly. I couldn't tell if Grok 4's attempt was rendering at all. Claude did render rocks and mountains, but it's not what I want and seems difficult or impossible I could coax Claude into what I want.

- now looking at asset packs...
	- realistic
		- [cgtrader asset packs](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/valley)
		- [mars terrain asset pack](https://superhivemarket.com/products/mars-terrain-asset-pack/docs)
	- stylized
		- [Synty sci-fi worlds](https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-sci-fi-worlds)
			- include demo scenes
			- Unity only... but could port...
- tutorials to create my own...
	- [Godot 4 Terrain Building (with Blender!) | Michael Jared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uBdnktkuHU)
		- can use [Terrain3D addon for Godot 4](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D)
			- [docs](https://terrain3d.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/tutorial_videos.html) + tutorials
			- recommended, too: [Asset Placer](https://cookiebadger.itch.io/assetplacer); Sky3D
			- [rocks asset pack for Godot](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/eyno2/godot-cliffs-rocks-asset-pack-1)
		- ... or Blender
			- [tutorial by Nanotech Gamedev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QntjGdLnCEk)
	- textures
		- [perplexity search](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/godot-4-terrain3d-textures-33uum55DSWGtoZM5RlrEpw)
		- [textures on Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/textures/terrain)

chosen textures:
- [Gravelly Sand](https://polyhaven.com/a/gravelly_sand)
- [Cliff Side](https://polyhaven.com/a/cliff_side)

Ultimately, I settled on using Terrain3D with the texture above to create terrain right inside Godot. It had/has a learning curve, but is a powerful tool.
