- [ ] improve look and feel following [Recreating Star Fox's Rail Movement | Mix and Jam](https://youtu.be/JVbr7osMYTo?feature=shared)
- tried Midjourney -> Meshy pipeline
	- I got pretty good results but the Meshy model needs edits... time to learn Blender?
- should I used Blender or Godot to create the planet and the track?
	- [Claude initially suggested Blender](https://claude.ai/chat/60b25ef3-e504-4ff2-94f6-d1ba8aac8edd), but it sounds like Godot is capable and easier for me
- aiming...
	- at first I had the crosshairs fixed to the center of the ship and the bullets fired forward
	- this felt off... so I had the bullets target the center of the far crosshair... but it wasn't far enough, and bullets criss-crossed beyond it
	- setting the target distance farther... didn't align with the crosshairs
	- my current solution, which finally _feels correct_ is to take the vector from crosshair1 to crosshair2, imagine a crosshair3 along the same vector but at BULLET_RECYCLE_DISTANCE, and aim at crosshair3
