## Key Success Milestones

**End of Day 3**: Playable single-player experience with progression
**End of Day 5**: Working multiplayer with core features complete  
**End of Day 7**: Polished, demonstrable game ready for evaluation

## Critical Dependencies
- Godot 3D learning curve (budget extra time for this)
- Asset acquisition/creation pipeline
- Multiplayer networking complexity
- Performance optimization requirements

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep art assets simple initially (geometric shapes work fine)
- Implement core mechanics before visual polish
- Test multiplayer early and often
- Have fallback to single-player if networking issues arise
