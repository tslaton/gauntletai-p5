Great idea! Let me analyze the Star Fox-style movement system and propose a plan to implement it in your
  Godot project.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine player.gd and player.tscn to understand gun setup      
     ☒ Examine bullet.gd and bullet.tscn to understand bullet spawning
     ☒ Identify and fix bullet position issue
     ☒ Create jet exhaust particle effect for player ship
     ☒ Create explosion effect for enemy destruction
     ☒ Implement Star Fox-style crosshair and ship movement
     ☐ Check main.tscn for scene structure
     ☐ Add boost mechanic
     ☐ Add barrel roll mechanic
     ☐ Implement rail/path following system

⏺ Proposed Implementation Plan for Star Fox-Style Movement

  Phase 1: Separate Crosshair from Ship Movement

  Current: Crosshair is fixed to ship position
  Goal: Independent crosshair that ship follows with delay

  Steps:
  1. Make crosshair a separate node that moves independently based on input
  2. Add smooth interpolation for ship to follow crosshair position
  3. Update rotation to look toward crosshair instead of velocity
  4. Bullets fire toward crosshair position, not ship forward

  Phase 2: Enhanced Ship Movement Feel (left off here)

  1. Banking/Tilting: Ship tilts based on horizontal movement (more dramatic than current)
  2. Lag/Momentum: Ship accelerates toward crosshair position with physics-based delay
  3. Overshoot: Allow slight overshoot when changing directions quickly
  4. Rotation Limits: Clamp ship rotation to prevent excessive spinning

  Phase 3: Boost Mechanic

  Implementation:
  1. Add boost state with cooldown timer
  2. During boost:
    - Increase movement speed multiplier
    - Add motion blur or speed lines effect
    - Enhance jet exhaust particles
    - Temporary invincibility frames
  3. Visual feedback: Camera FOV change, UI indicator

  Phase 4: Barrel Roll Mechanic

  Implementation:
  4. Detect double-tap input (left/right)
  5. Trigger 360° rotation animation
  6. During barrel roll:
    - Deflect incoming projectiles
    - Brief invincibility
    - Maintain forward momentum
  7. Add particle trail effect during roll
  8. Cooldown to prevent spam

  Phase 5: Rail/Path Following System

  Implementation:
  9. Create Path3D nodes in levels
  10. Add PathFollow3D node for camera/player base position
  11. Player moves relative to path position
  12. Smooth transitions between path segments
  13. Branch paths for alternate routes
  14. Cinematic moments (loops, tight turns)

  Technical Considerations:

  - Use lerp() or move_toward() for smooth interpolation
  - Separate input handling for crosshair vs ship movement
  - State machine for boost/barrel roll/normal states
  - Camera shake/effects for impact and excitement
  - UI elements for boost meter and indicators

  Would you like me to start implementing Phase 1 (separating the crosshair from ship movement)?
