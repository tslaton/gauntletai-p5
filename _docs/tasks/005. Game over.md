When the player's health goes <= 0, the player's ship should explode. The game should stop and display "Game Over" with an option to Retry or Quit below

<!-- claude -->

⏺ I'll implement the game over functionality with player explosion and a game over screen. Let me start by creating the necessary components:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Add explosion effect when player dies   
     ☐ Create game over UI screen
     ☐ Implement pause/stop game functionality
     ☐ Add retry and quit buttons functionalit

...

⏺ Perfect! I've implemented the complete game over functionality:

  Summary of Changes:

  1. Player Death with Explosion:

  - When player health reaches 0, the die() function is called
  - Creates an explosion effect at the player's position
  - Hides the player sprite and disables processing
  - Emits the player_died signal

  2. Game Over Screen:

  - Created game_over.tscn with a centered panel showing "GAME OVER"
  - Two buttons: "RETRY" and "QUIT"
  - Dark semi-transparent background panel with red border
  - Large text for clear visibility

  3. Game Pause Functionality:

  - When game over screen appears, the game tree is paused
  - The UI has process_mode = PROCESS_MODE_WHEN_PAUSED so buttons remain interactive
  - Prevents enemies and bullets from continuing to move

  4. Button Functionality:

  - RETRY: Unpauses the game and reloads the current scene
  - QUIT: Exits the application
  - Player respawn function updated to restore visibility and processing

  5. Game Flow:

  1. Player takes damage until health reaches 0
  2. Player ship explodes with visual effect
  3. After 1 second delay, game over screen appears
  4. Game pauses, showing options to retry or quit
  5. Retry restarts the level, Quit exits the game

  The game now has a complete death and game over system with visual feedback and user options!

ERROR: res://main.gd:56 - Parse Error: Expected indented block after function declaration.
ERROR: modules/gdscript/gdscript.cpp:3022 - Failed to load script "res://main.gd" with error "Parse error".

<!-- claude -->

⏺ I need to fix the parse error in main.gd. The issue is that the _on_quit_pressed function has a comment but no actual code, which causes a parse error. Let me fix it:

⏺ Update(main.gd)
  ⎿  Updated main.gd with 2 additions and 1 removal 
       54      get_tree().reload_current_scene()
       55    
       56    func _on_quit_pressed():
       57 -    # Quit is handled by the game_over UI
       57   \ No newline at end of file
       58 +    # Quit is handled by the game_over UI
       59 +    pass
       60   \ No newline at end of file

⏺ The error is fixed. In GDScript, every function needs at least one statement in its body. Since the quit functionality is handled by the game_over UI itself, I added a pass statement to provide a valid function body.
