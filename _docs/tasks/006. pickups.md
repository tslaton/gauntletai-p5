When an enemy dies, give them a 10% chance of spawning a laser pickup and a 20% chance of spawing a health pickup (it should move toward the player in a straight line from where the enemy died, continuing the enemy's trajectory). Refer to @assets/models/ for the relevant models to use. A pickup should slowly rotate about the y axis to mimic the expected behavior common in many games.

⏺ I'll help you implement pickup spawning when enemies die. Let me start by examining the enemy code to understand the death system.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Find and examine enemy death code             
     ☐ Create pickup scene for laser powerup
     ☐ Create pickup scene for health/repairs powerup
     ☐ Implement pickup spawning logic on enemy death
     ☐ Add pickup collection logic to player

...

⏺ Done! I've implemented the pickup system with:

  1. Laser pickup (10% spawn chance) - uses laser_pickup.glb model
  2. Health/repairs pickup (20% spawn chance) - uses repairs_pickup.glb model

  The pickups:
  - Move forward continuing the enemy's trajectory
  - Rotate slowly around the Y axis
  - Are collected when touching the player
  - Health pickups restore 20 HP, laser pickups restore 10 HP (placeholder effect)

  The system is ready to test in Godot!

When the laser upgrade is picked up, it should upgrade the player's laser_stage. laser_stage 1 should fire gun0 (currently not used) and do 10 damage. laser_stage 2 should fire gun1 and gun2 (like it does now) and do 20 gamage. laser_stage 3 should fire gun1 and gun2 but use blue bullets (either programmatically recolor the existing bullet or copy it with a neon blue color). Stage 3 should do 30 damage.

⏺ I'll implement the laser upgrade system with different stages. Let me start by adding the laser_stage variable and updating the weapon system.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Add laser_stage variable and Gun0 reference to player               
     ☐ Update shoot_at_crosshair to use different guns based on laser_stage
     ☐ Update bullet damage based on laser_stage
     ☐ Update collect_pickup to increment laser_stage
     ☐ Create blue bullet variant for stage 3

...

⏺ Perfect! I've implemented the laser upgrade system with the following features:

  1. Stage 1: Fires from Gun0 (center gun) with 10 damage
  2. Stage 2: Fires from Gun1 and Gun2 (side guns) with 20 damage
  3. Stage 3: Fires from Gun1 and Gun2 with blue bullets and 30 damage

  The system:
  - Starts at laser_stage 1 by default
  - Upgrades when collecting laser pickups (max stage 3)
  - Emits a laser_upgraded signal when upgrading
  - Blue bullets have a neon blue emission color with higher energy

  The player's weapon system now progressively gets stronger as they collect laser pickups
