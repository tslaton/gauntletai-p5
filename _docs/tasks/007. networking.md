We want to add networked multiplayer to the game. The player states and game state should be kept in sync in real-time. And, I will need a way to test it. Append to "007. networking.md" tasks describing  in phases and steps that a junior engineer could follow to implement the feature. Ask me for clarification where needed. Already I am wondwering: does Godot have a server it runs? what's the simplest system we can start with that would allow friends to join each other's games? is it easier (and notably different in core implementation details) if we start with LAN-only networked multiplayer? How can I test that multiplayer is working on a single machine?

⏺ Before I write the detailed implementation plan, let me address your questions and ask for clarification:

  Your Questions Answered:

  1. Godot's networking: Godot has built-in high-level multiplayer API that can work as peer-to-peer or client-server. It doesn't provide a dedicated server - you need to run one instance as the
  host/server.
  2. Simplest system: The easiest start is peer-to-peer where one player hosts and others join directly via IP. No external servers needed.
  3. LAN vs Internet: LAN is much simpler - no NAT traversal, port forwarding, or relay servers needed. The core implementation is the same, but Internet play adds connection complexity.
  4. Testing on one machine: You can run multiple Godot instances on the same computer, connecting via localhost (127.0.0.1).

  Clarification Questions:

  1. Player count: How many players should the game support? (2, 4, 8?)
  2. Game mode: Should all players be on the same team shooting enemies, or will there be PvP elements?
  3. Host authority: Should the host have special powers (pause, restart), or should all players be equal?
  4. Join mechanism: Are you okay starting with manual IP entry, or do you want a lobby/matchmaking system eventually?
  5. Persistence: Should the game continue if the host disconnects, or end the session?

  Let me write the implementation plan assuming:
  - 2-4 players cooperative gameplay
  - Start with LAN/direct IP connection
  - Host has authority
  - Manual IP entry to join
  - Session ends if host disconnects

# Networked Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements cooperative multiplayer for the rail shooter using Godot's high-level multiplayer API. Players can host/join games via direct IP connection, with synchronized player states and game state.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Testing Setup

### Step 1.1: Create Multiplayer Manager
1. Create `multiplayer/multiplayer_manager.gd` as an autoload singleton
2. Add basic structure:
   ```gdscript
   extends Node
   
   const DEFAULT_PORT = 7000
   const MAX_CLIENTS = 3
   
   signal player_connected(id)
   signal player_disconnected(id)
   signal connection_failed()
   signal connection_succeeded()
   ```

3. Add to Project Settings → Autoload as "MultiplayerManager"

### Step 1.2: Implement Host/Join Functions
1. Add host function:
   ```gdscript
   func host_game(port: int = DEFAULT_PORT) -> bool:
       var peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
       var result = peer.create_server(port, MAX_CLIENTS)
       if result == OK:
           multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = peer
           return true
       return false
   ```

2. Add join function:
   ```gdscript
   func join_game(address: String, port: int = DEFAULT_PORT) -> bool:
       var peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
       var result = peer.create_client(address, port)
       if result == OK:
           multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = peer
           return true
       return false
   ```

### Step 1.3: Create Simple Test UI
1. Create `ui/multiplayer_menu.tscn` with:
   - Host button
   - IP address input field
   - Join button
   - Status label

2. Add to main menu or as overlay

### Step 1.4: Setup Local Testing
1. In Project Settings → Editor → Network → Debug:
   - Enable "Remote Port" and set different ports (e.g., 6007, 6008)
2. Document testing process:
   - Run multiple editor instances
   - One hosts, others join via "127.0.0.1"

## Phase 2: Player Synchronization

### Step 2.1: Prepare Player Scene
1. Add MultiplayerSynchronizer node to player scene
2. Configure properties to sync:
   - position
   - rotation
   - laser_stage
   - current_health

### Step 2.2: Implement Player Spawning
1. Create `multiplayer/player_spawner.gd`:
   ```gdscript
   extends MultiplayerSpawner
   
   func _ready():
       spawn_path = get_node("/root/Main")
       spawn_function = _spawn_player
   
   func _spawn_player(id: int) -> Node:
       var player = preload("res://player/player.tscn").instantiate()
       player.name = "Player_" + str(id)
       player.set_multiplayer_authority(id)
       return player
   ```

### Step 2.3: Handle Player Authority
1. Modify player.gd:
   ```gdscript
   func _ready():
       set_multiplayer_authority(name.to_int())
       if not is_multiplayer_authority():
           # Disable input processing for non-local players
           set_physics_process(false)
           set_process_unhandled_input(false)
   ```

### Step 2.4: Sync Player Actions
1. Use RPCs for actions:
   ```gdscript
   @rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
   func shoot_at_crosshair_rpc():
       # Existing shoot logic
   
   # In _physics_process:
   if is_multiplayer_authority() and should_shoot:
       shoot_at_crosshair_rpc.rpc()
   ```

## Phase 3: Game State Synchronization

### Step 3.1: Create Game State Manager
1. Create `multiplayer/game_state.gd`:
   ```gdscript
   extends Node
   
   @export var enemy_spawn_seed: int = 0
   @export var game_time: float = 0.0
   @export var total_score: int = 0
   
   signal state_updated
   ```

### Step 3.2: Synchronize Enemy Spawning
1. Modify enemy_spawner.gd:
   - Only spawn on host/server
   - Use deterministic random seed
   - Broadcast spawn events via RPC

### Step 3.3: Sync Pickups and Effects
1. Add authority checks:
   - Only host spawns pickups
   - Clients request pickup collection
   - Host validates and broadcasts result

## Phase 4: Connection Management

### Step 4.1: Handle Disconnections
1. In MultiplayerManager:
   ```gdscript
   func _ready():
       multiplayer.peer_connected.connect(_on_peer_connected)
       multiplayer.peer_disconnected.connect(_on_peer_disconnected)
   ```

### Step 4.2: Implement Graceful Shutdown
1. Add cleanup when host leaves
2. Show "Connection Lost" message to clients
3. Return to main menu

### Step 4.3: Add Connection Status UI
1. Show connected players list
2. Display connection quality/ping
3. Add disconnect button

## Phase 5: Testing and Polish

### Step 5.1: Create Test Scenarios
1. Document test cases:
   - Host creates game, client joins
   - Multiple clients join
   - Client disconnects and rejoins
   - Host disconnects (game ends)
   - Packet loss simulation

### Step 5.2: Add Debug Overlay
1. Create debug UI showing:
   - Network role (host/client)
   - Connected peers
   - Sync statistics
   - Latency

### Step 5.3: Performance Optimization
1. Implement interpolation for smooth movement
2. Add client-side prediction
3. Optimize sync rates

## Testing Guide

### Local Machine Testing:
1. Open project in Godot
2. Debug → Run Multiple Instances → Run 2 Instances
3. In first instance: Host game
4. In second instance: Join via 127.0.0.1
5. Test player movement, shooting, pickups

### LAN Testing:
1. Find host's local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
2. Ensure firewall allows port 7000
3. Other players join using host's IP

### Debug Commands:
- F9: Toggle network debug overlay
- F10: Simulate packet loss
- F11: Force disconnect

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 6: Internet Play (Optional)
1. Implement NAT punch-through
2. Add relay server fallback
3. Create lobby system
4. Add matchmaking

### Phase 7: Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Spectator mode
2. Mid-game joining
3. Host migration
4. Replay system

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Connection failed"**: Check firewall, ensure correct IP/port
2. **"Desync issues"**: Verify all RPCs are reliable, check authority
3. **"Lag/jitter"**: Implement interpolation, reduce sync frequency
4. **"Can't see other players"**: Check MultiplayerSpawner setup

⏺ I've created a comprehensive multiplayer implementation plan that addresses your questions:

  Key Points:
  - Simplest approach: Peer-to-peer with one player hosting, others joining via IP
  - LAN-first: Easier to implement and test, same core code works for internet (just needs extra networking setup)
  - Testing: You can run multiple Godot instances on one machine using localhost (127.0.0.1)
  - No dedicated server needed: One player's game acts as the host

  The plan is structured in phases:
  1. Phase 1: Basic networking setup and UI
  2. Phase 2: Player synchronization
  3. Phase 3: Game state sync (enemies, pickups)
  4. Phase 4: Connection handling
  5. Phase 5: Testing and optimization

  The implementation uses Godot's built-in high-level multiplayer API with:
  - ENetMultiplayerPeer for networking
  - MultiplayerSynchronizer for automatic property syncing
  - MultiplayerSpawner for spawning players
  - RPCs for actions like shooting

  Would you like me to clarify any part of the plan or adjust it based on your specific requirements?
